# my_wallpapers
These are just some wallpapers for my linux machine.
Its just easy to clone this repo and use the wallpapers on any machine rather than searching for them or sharing them.


If you wanna use them then here is the guide -

Step 0 - Make a new directory/folder.

Step 1 - cd into that directory (Fow windows users - Open that directory in cmd)

Step 2 - install git

Step 3 - Run 

git clone https://github.com/hellcatWahran/my_wallpapers

in your terminal/cmd

And you will get all the wallpapers in that directory/folder U created earlier.
